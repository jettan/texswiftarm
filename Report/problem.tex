\chapter{Problem}

The goal of this project is to create an application that runs on a Samsung SmartTV and uses the libswift peer-to-peer engine to donwload, upload and stream files. Libswift must run on the television natively. Additionally dispersy and DHT can also be run natively and be integrated into the application in order to incorporate search functionality.

Usability is not a primary goal, the application is meant as a proof of concept to show that televisions are capable of supporting peer-to-peer applications, in this case using the libswift engine. Although we will try to work towards an end product, due to our focus being on the peer-to-peer aspects and possible technical limitations, the application may need more work to become more user friendly.
