\chapter{Conclusion}
Based on the final product of the project it is safe to say that peer-to-peer applications involving streaming, downloading and uploading of files is possible on smart TV's. Due to hardware limitations the application was never able to reach its full potential but the results are very promising for future televisions with better hardware. Dispite the hardware issues, the technology does work which makes our application is the first fourth generation peer-to-peer file sharing application in the world.

Another important aspect as to whether more advanced applications will be developed for televisions is the amount of freedom manufacturers are willing to give to developers. As it stands, television manufacturers seem very weary of giving any access to their TV's, which is very understandable from a security point of view. However, if the full potential of the smart TV is to be reached, developers must be given full access to develop advanced programs or else the smart TV will remain a gimmick with limited functionality.
