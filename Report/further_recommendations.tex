A major limitation during this project was the hardware in the television. The application we built depends on reasonably heavy python programs and requires quite a lot of memory when streaming. Although the CPU seemed to be able to keep up, the lack of memory was very noticable when streaming. Thankfully, as technology improves and becomes cheaper, televisions will get better hardware and it will not be long untill they will be able to easily run application like this one. For future versions of peer-to-peer applications on televisions, better hardware is a must.
