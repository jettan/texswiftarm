\chapter*{Preface}
In the third year of the Computer Science curriculum at Delft University of Technology, students have to do their Bachelor project where they have to work under supervision of a client being a company or a professor at the university. This project consists of creating a software solution for a given realistic problem with the skills and knowledge that are obtained during the Bachelor programme.

This report is part of our Bachelor Project, carried out in the academic year 2011-2012. The goal of this project is to develop a 4th generation peer-to-peer application to be used on a Samsung SmartTV.

We would like to thank our supervisor, J.A. Pouwelse, and the Tribler team, who helped us with this project. In particular, we would like to thank for their help:
