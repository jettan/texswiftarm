\chapter*{Preface}
In the third year of the Computer Science course in Delft, students have to do their Bachelor project, 
where they have to work under supervision of a professor.

This report is part of our Bachelor Project, carried out in the academic year 2011-2012. The goal of this project is to develop a 4th generation peer-to-peer application to be used on a Samsung Smart TV.

We would like to thank our supervisor and the Tribler team, who helped us with this project.
