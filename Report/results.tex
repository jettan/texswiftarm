\chapter{Results}
This chapter discusses the results of our project. A description of the built application will be given, alongside with screenshots.
Also, graphs will be used to show the performance of our application.

\section{SwiftTV}
Since we built a download and stream application for the Samsung SmartTV based on libswift, we dubbed our application SwiftTV.
The name is kept simple because other existing applications based on libswift have similar names. This section explains how SwiftTV works.

\section{Measurements}
For this section, we measured the CPU and memory usage of the application. We measured these values against the time and the bitrate.
